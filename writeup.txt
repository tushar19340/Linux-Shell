test cases:
ls
mkdir temp
ls temp
mkdir -v
cd temp
ls
mkdir temp
rm temp
pwd
echo "hello from temp"
history
history -c
exit



program flow:

I have run a infinite while loop to take commands continously.
I have taken the command in a char array 'command' and split by space using strtok.
Then Saved all the splitted word of the command into and array 'commands'.
After that I check for which command is requested and handled the cases by using if statements.
Each command can take two options and will give the output accordingly.

errors:
If the user enters any invalid command then it will show the error.
If the user enters more or less no. of required arguments in command the it will show invalid no. of arguments.
I have also handled the error if the fork() call fails.
